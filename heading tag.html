  <p>The early history of Islam in Bengal is divided into two phases. The first phase is the period of maritime trade
    with Arabia and Persia between the 8th and 12th centuries. The second phase covers centuries of Muslim dynastic rule
    after the Islamic conquest of Bengal. The writings of Al-Idrisi, Ibn Hawqal, Al-Masudi, Ibn Khordadbeh and Sulaiman
    record the maritime links between Arabia, Persia and Bengal.<br>[49] Muslim trade with Bengal flourished after the
    fall of the Sasanian Empire and the Arab takeover of Persian trade routes. Much of this trade occurred with
    southeastern Bengal in areas east of the Meghna River.<br> There is speculation regarding the presence of a Muslim
    community in Bangladesh as early as 690 CE; this is based on the discovery of one of South Asia's oldest mosques in
    northern Bangladesh.[50][51][49] Bengal was possibly used as a transit route to China by the earliest Muslims.
    Abbasid
    coins have been discovered in the archaeological ruins of Paharpur and Mainamati.[52] A collection of Sasanian,
    Umayyad and Abbasid coins are preserved in the Bangladesh National Museum.[53]</p>
